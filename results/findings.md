`Observation:` One set of dimensions is good at picking out the MISC class, while another set of dimensions is good at picking out the PER class.
`Hypothesis:` While there are more than two classes, the class information can be distributed unevenly. Some dimensions are used to predict one class, which other different dimensions are used to predict another class.

`Observation:` A single dimension can differentiate two classes as good as many dimensions combined. 
`Hypothesis`: This might mean that some dimensions can be meaningful to capture distict features between classes, although most of the information is distributed.

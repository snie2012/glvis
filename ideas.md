The general idea is to query the neural network for information in a way meaningful for the nueral network. While we have that information, we try to understand those information in human domain terms.

For examples:

1. LSTMVis. It queries meaningful information from a neural network by matching activation patterns. Once those information are queries, they are annoted with domain knowledge to make sense to human.

2. Dimensionality. IT queries meaningful information from a neural network by reduce the dimensionality and discover cluster. Then each cluster is annotated with domain knowledge to make sense to human.

3. RNNVis. Influence function to query information.
